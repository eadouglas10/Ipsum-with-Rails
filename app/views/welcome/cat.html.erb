  Intently sniff hand mark territory, yet rub face on everything. This human feeds me, i should be a god hopped up on catnip, so see owner, run in terror. Gnaw the corn cob asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) but purr while eating yet ears back wide eyed jump off balcony, onto stranger's head so sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter or spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face destroy couch as revenge, please stop looking at your phone and pet me, meowing non stop for food have secret plans, tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed always hungry stare at ceiling, for cat is love, cat is life so burrow under covers, so stare at ceiling light. Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) make muffins, but burrow under covers. Eat from dog's food vommit food and eat it again sleep nap or soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep so spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce.
